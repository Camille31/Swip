*******************************

The aim of this application is to add some predicates to a knowledge base writen
in a RDF serialisation language. It supports OWL, Turtle and N-Triples formats.


I - First use
______________

You can launch this application using the command :
		java -jar AddPredicates.jar

The fist execution of the program will generate a default configuration file
(cf. part III), and two direcories "knowledge_base" and "generated_files" in the
same directory in which you placed the jar file.

II - Default use and configuration
___________________________________

When the default configuration is settled, you must place all your files that you
want to analyse in the knowledge_base directory.
When you run this program for the second time, it tries to load each file in the
knowledge_base directory and write for each one (in separated files) the description
of the added predicates in the generated_files directory.

With the default configuration, the program searches all resources that have not
a predicate <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> defined. For each one,
it extracts the name parsing its URI : it takes first the end part of the URI
(the local part) and parses it replacing all underscores by spaces and separating
differents words used, according to the CamelCase format. Finally, it generates
a file containing all triplets defining a new <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>
predicate which value is the name extracted from the URI.

You can change this default behavior by editing the configuration file generated
at the first use of this application.

III - The configuration file
_____________________________

The configuration file let you the possibility to define seven properties :
		- MODE
		- KB_PATH
		- GENERATED_PATH
		- SEARCHED_PREDICATE
		- ADDED_PREDICATE
		- LANGUAGE_TAG
		- IGNORED_PREFIXES

The usage of each property is explain in the configuration file. If you remove
one of those properties, it is restaured with default value(s). If you want to
settle the default configuration, you just have to remove this configuration file.
